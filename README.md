# Project 1: Python Foundations - FoodHub Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes FoodHub order data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights. By leveraging Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and sales performance.

## Project Structure
- **Python foundations.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **foodhub_order.csv**  
  Dataset with order details, customer information, and sales data.
- **README.md**  
  Documentation, installation guides, and usage instructions.

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**  
- Python 3.x
